# Introduction

Are you trying to build a quadruped robot? Are you trying to understand code in this repository? If you answered yes to either question, you are in the right place. This tutorial will provide a comprehensive guide for building a quadruped robot while providing details on how important pieces of code in this repository function and relate to their conceptual counterparts.

### Goal

The goal is to design a quadruped robot that looks like a dog. A lot of tutorials explain how to build a spider-looking quadruped. However, the concepts are exactly the same. This tutorial is intended to cover various mathematically and engineering concepts used in constructing the robot. It does not teach you how to build a robot step by step, nor should it be seen as such.

### Warnings

This guide is in no way comprehensive. I am not accountable for errors in this document. Don't let this guide prevent you from thinking of new designs, concepts, and algorithms. Remember that I am no expert on this subject. Your ideas could very well be better than mine. At the same time, don't attempt to reinvent the wheel. If something is efficient and works for your purpose, use it.

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil." Test and measure. Don't guess.

### Read Me

While researching, I chanced upon the *Springer Handbook of Robotics*. Before proceeding, read section 16.5 of the book found [here](http://home.deib.polimi.it/gini/robot/docs/legged.pdf). If you are serious about robotics, I recommend that you find this book in the library or get an eBook. This book basically covers everything you need to know about advanced robotics and even provides historical background. You probably won't understand everything in this literature. That is completely okay. This is just an introduction.

You should also read through the [SPS](https://github.com/bobbyluig/Eclipse/raw/master/docs/cdr/SPS.pdf) and [POC](https://github.com/bobbyluig/Eclipse/raw/master/docs/cdr/POC.pdf) documents. They provide comprehensive details on our robots. This tutorial goes in depth on what is not covered by those documents. You will be confused if you do not at least skim through them.

### Corrections

I will put errors in the documents here as I find them.

- Pg. 88-91: All references to dot products should be changed to matrix multiplication. All $\bullet$ should be removed from the equations.

### Prerequisites

Trying to accomplish this project requires that you are not scared of math and physics. You will need a strong foundation in geometry, trigonometry, algebra, classical mechanics, and preliminary linear algebra. You will also need a deep understanding of calculus, although you might not ever need to take a derivative in this project. It would help that you also understand some practical electricity and magnetism.

This tutorial is written assuming you have limited understanding of linear algebra. Concepts clarifications are linked to external resources as they appear. You're welcome.

# Definitions

It is important to define everything before starting this project. It will save you a lot of time. Don't invent your own coordinate system like me and waste 2 weeks :p.

### Coordinate System

The world runs on the right-handed coordinate system. Being left-handed, I accidentally used the left-handed coordinate system, which ended up causing me a lot of confusion. Don't be like me. Clearly define the coordinate system before beginning. This is not to say you can't use the left-handed system. Just make sure you know what you're doing, because pretty much everything on the Internet uses the right-handed system.

![](assets/table.jpg)

Pretend the robot is a table. The head points in the positive x direction. The left side points in the positive y direction. The top of the table points to the positive z axis. The image is there for clarification.

### Vocabulary

End effector
: In kinematics, the end of a robotic arm or leg. In this case, it is the tip of the feet.

Output spline
: The part of the servo that is visible and spins. It has teeth to transfer torque.

Root
: In kinematics, the point at which the arm or leg attaches to the body.
	
Zero position
: Referring to legs, the position when all servos are targeting zero degrees as defined by their kinematic equations.
	
# Leg Design

Speaking of walking robots, the legs are probably important. 

### Alignment

While working on leg designs for the robot, I noticed that various things simply work well if rotational axes are aligned. As you can see in the images below, the end effector is aligned with the rotational axes of the top two servos. The rotational axes of the top two servos also intersect each other. Both images show the leg in zero position.

<div class="center">
![](assets/leg1.png)\ ![](assets/leg2.png)
</div>

Theoretically, having aligned legs not only helps simplify kinematics and torque computations, but also allows for more efficiency in motion.

### Considerations

Of course, it is not strictly necessary to design an aligned leg. The most important aspect of leg design is purpose. For example, the original intentional of our servo layout was to allow the robot to flip itself over. However, this functionality was not needed. In that case, the locations of the top two servos can actually be switched. 

# Kinematics

This is perhaps the most math intensive and important portion of the project. The goal is to create two equations. One equation will take angles and output a point. The other will do the reverse. Sounds easy? It's not.

### Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics (FK) is kind of like taking a derivative. There can be a lot of steps and it can get messy, but it's always possible. For the purpose of this tutorial, I will assume that each leg has three DOF, which is pretty standard. Each servo will have a $\theta$ value. The forward kinematic function $f(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)$ should output $(x, y, z)$, where the end effector is given the angles.

If you are good at trigonometry, FK can be solved starting from the servo closest to the body. An example can be seen [here](http://www.stagrobotics.com/stag.html). However, it does not have to be solved that way. You can also apply [rotational matrices](http://inside.mines.edu/fs_home/gmurray/ArbitraryAxisRotation/) when they are convenient to use. I've generalized the use of rotation matrices to be:

1. Check to see if you can ignore any segments. This can happen when the line formed by the segment is the axis of rotation for a servo attached to that segment.
2. Try to reduce the problem to a 2D one and use basic trigonometry to consume one or more $\theta$s.
3. Apply rotational matrices via [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) for any servos rotating about convenient axes.
4. Use trigonometry to solve for any remaining servos.

Use whichever method you find to be easier. Apply rotation matrices can be confusing. However, you will need to understand 3D trigonometry to do it the other way. Remember -- draw a diagram, take it slow, and test your solution.

### Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics (IK) is kind of like performing an integral. It involves some intuition and might not always be possible. Also, like an indefinite integral, more than one solution can exist. Be sure to solve the FK problem before approaching this one. 

IK should be solved from the servo furthest from the body. The last angle generally involves some form of the law of cosines. Once you solve one angle, see if you can plug it into any of the equations obtained from forward kinematics. The last part is mostly just intuition. You'll need to draw diagrams and model the leg somehow to help you visualize a solution. Take it slow. Solving the IK for my robot took me 2 weeks.

Remember that multiple solutions generally will exist. Anything involving the law of cosines can vary by $\pi$. Other trigonometric expressions can involve solutions with different signs. Be aware of this. Try to design the program to find all possible solutions. Write good tests that chain the working FK equations with the IK equations to rigorously test correctness.

There are software which you can use. If you do manage to obtain a non-manual solution, be sure that it can be evaluated very quickly.

### Code

Only one class controls the kinematics modules. The evaluation speed must be very fast or else real time performance will not be achieved.

Inverse Kinematics | `finesse.eclipse.Finesse.inverse_pack`, `finesse.paragon.Finesse.inverse_pack`

# Servos

Servos are what permits motion. More sophisticated robots make use of pneumatics. However, hobby servos can perform well with proper design and programming.

### Configuration

Servos generally come with information about their [Pulse Width Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) (PWM). These typically range from 1000 μs to 2000 μs, although you need to check the manufacturer's specification sheet as well as perform testing to determine the true PWM range.

I will not cover conversion from PWM to degrees, as I'm sure you can figure this out by either looking at the code or doing some math. The more interesting question is which direction is positive and which direction is negative in regards to the spin of the servos.

![](assets/servo.png)

We need to first define that lowering the PWM corresponds to decreasing the angle of the servo. Given that definition, it is simple to determine spin direction based on servo configuration. Look down the positive axis. In the image above, the eye is looking down the positive y axis. If the output spline is facing you (as in the image), then counterclockwise is positive and clockwise is negative. If the output spline is facing the other way, then the directions are flipped. However, both cases assume that the servo body is not the part rotating. If the output spline is attached and the body spins, everything is reversed.

Of course, there are multiple ways to implement this. In my implementation, if the output spline points towards a positive axis, it has a `direction` of 1. If it points towards a negative axis, it has a `direction` of -1. All other parameters are commented in the source code and should be easy to understand.

### Alternatives

Servos can target a specific location, but often has limited range and requires calibration after mounting. An alternative would be to use stepper motors. These motors run on two inductors. They have hundreds of clicks per rotation and each pulse will move the stepper one click in a specified direction. This allows easier calibration and better synchronization at the cost of torque and speed.

I have actually implemented a class for this. However, my team never managed to get the stepper motors working without burning them out. In addition, we lacked funds to get small steppers with sufficient torque.

### Code

There are two classes, one for servos and another for steppers. The `Stepper` class has not been tested extensively. Some functions in the `Servo` class are not used. They were written when I was testing different gait generation methods. However, they do work as expected and can be useful.

Concept|Implementation(s)

Servo | `agility.main.Servo`
Stepper | `agility.main.Stepper`

# Mini Maestro

The Pololu Maestro is perhaps the best servo controller in the world. I was not paid to advertise their product but honestly this project would not be possible without it. That is not to say that you cannot use an Arduino to complete this project. I'm just saying you should [buy](https://www.pololu.com/category/102/maestro-usb-servo-controllers) a Mini Maestro if you want to make your life easier.

### Communication

The Maestro communicates using USB or TTL. It is very easy to use the virtual command port with the `pyserial` library. I have already written a fully functional Python library for this, so you don't have to write your own. Additional information on command protocols can be seen in the [documentation](https://www.pololu.com/docs/pdf/0J40/maestro.pdf).

### Usc

Pololu has a low-level development library for controlling things such as script writing and device configuration. These cannot be accessed from `pyserial`. Pololu provides an SDK written in C#. This is particularly frustrating for Mac and Linux users. I woke up one Saturday morning and decided to rewrite the entire library in Python. I even managed to make a functional script complier. However, the default driver that comes with the Maestro on Windows is not compatible with `pyusb`. I recommend that you get [zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) and install `libusb-win32` over the default driver. Make sure that you're not installing it over the virtual Command or TTL port!

The Usc interface works exactly like the examples written in C#. You can take a look at them by downloading the [SDK](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J41). Scripting is also fully functional. It can be used like the example shown below.

```python
from agility.pololu.usc import Usc
from agility.pololu.reader import BytecodeReader

# Initialize.
usc = Usc()
reader = BytecodeReader()

# Clear errors.
usc.clearErrors()

# Load script.
with open('script.txt') as f:
	data = f.read()

# Compile
program = reader.read(data, False)

# Write output to file.
reader.writeListing(program, 'output.txt')

# Load program to device.
usc.loadProgram(program)
usc.setScriptDone(0)
```

Usually, you would have to install a GUI to configure device settings. However, that is no longer necessary. The Usc interface can write device and servo configuration data directly. The most useful feature is that it can automatically load desired servo startup positions based on configuration detailed in the `Servo` class. 

### Synchronization

A leg contains multiple servos. When it has to target a point in space, all servos should end together in a given amount of time. This is a synchronization problem. To solve it, we go through the following steps.

1. Update all servo positions for the leg.
2. Find how much each servo has to move.
3. Use the desired time and change in distance to compute speed.
4. Update speed for all servos.
5. Update all servo positions.

It is important to note that the Maestro measures all things in 0.25 μs rather than 1 μs. One speed unit is defined by the Maestro to be 0.25 μs / (10 ms). This means that if given the current position's PWM ($p_c$) in μs and the target position's PWM ($p_t$) in μs, the speed ($v$) can be computed using the equation below. Let $t$ be the desired transition time in ms.

$$v = \left\lfloor 40 \frac{\left|p_t - p_c\right|}{t} \right\rceil$$

The nearest integer function obviously creates some error. However, when considering small movements, this error can be negligible.

### Code

Multiple classes are related to the Maestro controller. The `Usc` class has been tested but should be used with caution as it can possibly corrupt the device.

Communication | `agility.maestro.Maestro`
Usc | `agility.pololu.usc.Usc`, `agility.main.Agility.configure`
Synchronization | `agility.maestro.Maestro.end_in`, `agility.maestro.Maestro.end_together`

# Movement

We want to translate user inputs of rotational motion ($rad / sec$) and forward motion ($cm / sec$) to physical robot motion. The first challenge is to use $d\theta$, the amount of rotation per cycle, and $dv$, the amount of forward motion per cycle, to generate proper gaits. The second challenge is to perform various gait optimizations to ensure that the robot walks smoothly. Note: this section is very math heavy.

### Vectors

My friend Alastair MacMillan came up with this amazing idea one day that basically made complex motion possible. For a moment, pretend that the robot is just a rectangle.

<div class="center">
![](assets/vector.png)\ ![](assets/vector1.png)
</div>

The vertexes or legs are number 0-3 accordingly. To rotate the rectangle, we can simply apply a vector tangent to a circumscribed circle at each vertex. The cool thing about vectors is that they can be view as separate components. To add forward or backward movement, simply add to the x component.

The easiest method to physically reproduce the vector is to compute $(x, y)$ and generate a line between $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$. Moving one cycle along the line will be twice the desired vector. 

The harder part is using $\theta$ to find $x$ and $y$. At every instantaneous moment in time, each leg applies a force. Relative to their respective roots the force is linear over time. However, when all four legs work together, the linear force becomes rotational. 

![](assets/vector2.png)

We define the width $w$ to be the distance along y and length $l$ to be the distance along x. Let $u$ be a matrix or width and length. The magnitude of the vector is defined to be $|\Delta|$ and the radius of the circle is $r$. A few things become immediately evident.

$$r = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{w^2 + l^2}$$
$$|\Delta| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$
$$B = \begin{bmatrix} w \\ l \end{bmatrix}$$

$\theta$, how much the robot will turn when the leg moves $\Delta$, is between $r$ and the hypotenuse. It can be solved using inverse tangent.

$$\theta = \arctan \left(\frac{|\Delta|}{r}\right)$$

The desired theta input is twice of that. So the input $d\theta = 2 \theta$. We can then solve for $|\Delta|$.

$$|\Delta| = r \tan \left(\frac{1}{2} d\theta \right)$$

The $(x, y)$ contribution from the rotation part is always perpendicular to the line from the center to the vertex. This means that we can use the [normalized vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector) of $B$ to find the desired values. Finally, add the desired forward contribution value for $dv$. Signs for the result is computed using a [Hadamard product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices)) and a predefined matrix $N$. Let $j$ be the index of the leg (0-3).

$$N = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$$
$$\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}_{j} = \left( |\Delta| \hat{B} + \begin{bmatrix}dv \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right) \circ N_{i,j+1}$$

I will expand this equation out for clarity, since it is very important for implementation.

$$x_{j} = r \tan \left(\frac{1}{2} d\theta \right) \sqrt{w^2 + l^2} \left(N_{1,j+1}\right)$$
$$y_{j} = r \tan \left(\frac{1}{2} d\theta \right) \sqrt{w^2 + l^2} \left(N_{2,j+1}\right)$$

### Gait Types

There are various gait types described in *Springer Handbook of Robotics*. However, I believe that trot and crawl are the two easier gaits to implement. Obviously, trot is much faster than crawl. However, testing should reveal the optimal transition speed and time. If both are graphed, if can be seen that this is an optimization problem. I did not have sufficient time to test thoroughly. However, if time $t$ can be found, it is easy to convert $rad / sec$ and $cm / sec$ to $d\theta$ and $dv$.

$$\begin{bmatrix} d\theta \\ dv \end{bmatrix} = t \begin{bmatrix} rad/sec \\ cm/sec \end{bmatrix}$$

I have not found significant differences between different leg orderings. However, this is because I have not done extensive testing. The robots use 1423 creeping gaits, although the other orderings work as well.

### Gait Generation

There are a few additional variables involved in gait generation. The variable $h$ defines how high the leg should lift and the variable $\beta$ determines the percent of time a leg is on the ground. My idea for gait generation was to have one gait per set of $(d\theta, dv)$. There are other ways to approach this of course.

Assuming that we have already computed the necessary $(x, y)$ value for the gait, we can go through a set of points and interpolate the data in between when needed. For the sake of simplicity, I designed all leg paths to be a rectangle. However, this may not be the most efficient method considering the natural leg path of quadrupeds such as dogs. I defined 5 points, although 4 should be sufficient. Note that $g$ is the desired ground level. It should be negative, but greater than the z value of the end effector in zero position. Basically, the legs should be slightly bent during motion, to ensure that all points can be reached.

$$(0, 0, g) \rightarrow (-x, -y, g) \rightarrow (-x, -y, g + h) \rightarrow (x, y, g + h) \rightarrow (x, y, g)$$

The interpolation should be defined for all time values. To do this, you can use the interpolation feature that comes with `scipy`. By generating time values for each point based on normalized distance traveled. I used linear, which I believe is best for this case. However, more circular gaits should probably employ cubic interpolation.

The next step is to apply the concepts of calculus and separate this gait into tiny $dt$ segments. Note that $t$ in this case would be the time for one complete cycle of the gait. This $dt$ value is really dependent on the speed of the servo controller and the servos themselves. Servos generally run at a 50 Hz loop, implying that $dt$ should be at least 20 ms. I have found that 20 ms - 100 ms work well.

By generating $t / dt$ linearly spaced time points, we can then evaluate them in our interpolation equations to obtain points for execution.

### Gait Execution

Execution requires interfacing with various other modules. Once points for all four legs are obtained, they can be fed one frame at a time to the inverse kinematics equations, which will provide angles for the servos. Each frame is exactly $dt$ long. There are two possible ways to approach this (that I've thought of). One way is to send the command to move all the servos and wait $dt$ before executing the next one. However, I've found that Python is not very good at keeping accurate time. Instead, I chose to check if all servos have reached their target before executing the next frame. This is actually slower, as there is latency involved with checking and executing. Thus, one cycle will be slightly longer (probably negligible) than $t$.

There are various other layers of complexity that must be considered to ensure that the robot can actually walk smoothly. They are discussed in the next three sections.

### Center of Mass

If the gait is execute without any adjustments, the robot will not walk -- it will fall and stumble. This is due to the fact that the center of mass (COM) is not being adjusted. As you can see in the image, the COM must fall inside of the support triangle made by three legs for crawl gaits.

![](assets/com.png)

First, let's define a few things. Let $(c_x, c_y)$ be the COM of the robot in its current position. This can be simplified to a static value or computed using the positions of the legs. Let $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ be the locations of two support legs across from each other. In the image above, they would be legs 0 and 3.

The shortest path to the inside of the triangle is the perpendicular to the slope formed by the two support legs. We need to find where on the line is the closest to the COM. To do this, Alastair derived this equation, which took me a while to understand. It is basically a lot of $y = mx + b$ manipulations. Let $(x_0, y_0)$ be the point on the line we are interested in.

$$m = \frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)}$$
$$b = y_1 - m x_1$$
$$x_0 = \frac{x_0 + m y_0 - mb}{m^2 + 1}$$
$$y_0 = m x_0 + b$$

Do the order of the points matter? No. If you look at the code, it may appear that it does. However, the order is for other optimizations. If working with the trot gait, this is enough because the COM simply has to be on the line. I use the variable $\delta$ to indicate how much the body must move.

$$\delta_{x,trot} = x_0 - c_x$$
$$\delta_{y,trot} = y_0 - c_y$$

Optimally, this would work for crawl as well. However, it would be even better to move the COM further into the support triangle. I used $\sigma$ to represent the safety margin. Rather than adjusting to a point on the line, the robot will move into the support triangle an additional $\sigma$. There is a flaw in this because $\sigma$ is **not** the stability margin. When close to the sides of the triangle, it may be possible that moving $\sigma$ may cause the stability margin to be less than $\sigma$ on another side. It is even possible that the adjustment can throw the COM outside of the support triangle. I have not written in any protection for this as it usually is not a problem. However, this is definitely something to think about for improving motion.

Interestingly, order matters here with $\sigma$. I believe there is another way but this is just my take on it, since was really short on time. Which point comes first and which comes second depends on which leg is lifted. Testing basically reveals the following.

$$0: (2,1)$$
$$1: (0,3)$$
$$2: (3,0)$$
$$3: (1,2)$$

The following equations can then be applied to find $\delta$ for crawl gait. It basically uses trigonometric properties of perpendicular lines. Note that you must use the `atan2` function in your favorite programming language because signs are very important here. Also note that these are implemented **incorrectly** in the actual code (forgot to subtract COM). But hey, it still worked alright because I set a huge $\sigma$.

$$\DeclareMathOperator{\atantwo}{atan2}$$
$$\theta = \atantwo \left((y_2 - y_1),(x_2 , x_1) \right)$$
$$\delta_{x,crawl} = \sigma \sin \left( \theta \right) + x_0 - c_x$$
$$\delta_{y,crawl} = -\sigma \cos \left( \theta \right) + y_0 - c_y$$

I did static COM computations for $(c_x, c_y)$, but you should use the inverse kinematics equations to compute the location of each segment of the leg and use it to produce a more accurate computation. The servos are actually relatively heavy so the leg positions visibly contribute to the COM.

### Static Optimization

Adjustments to the gait can be made before execution. This is especially true with the COM. All operations rely on the use of `numpy`, which basically uses vectorized operations in C. Because gait generation is called frequently, other programming optimizations such as caching should be used as well.

We'll redefine $\delta$ to be a 4 x 3 matrix rather than individual values of $\delta_x$, $\delta_y$, and $\delta_z$ (0). Let $F$ be a 4 x 3 matrix such that each row $i$ contains an $(x, y, z)$ which indicates the target position of leg at index $i - 1$.

$$\delta = \begin{bmatrix}
\delta_x & \delta_y & 0 \\
\delta_x & \delta_y & 0 \\
\delta_x & \delta_y & 0 \\
\delta_x & \delta_y & 0
\end{bmatrix}$$
$$F = \begin{bmatrix}
x_{0} & y_{0} & z_{0} \\
x_{1} & y_{1} & z_{1} \\
x_{2} & y_{2} & z_{2} \\
x_{3} & y_{3} & z_{3}
\end{bmatrix}$$

Remember that $\delta$ is how much the body has to move while $F$ is the position of the legs. To translate the body, we can simply apply Newton's third law of motion.

$$F^\prime = F - \delta$$

The optimized pose for the legs, $F^\prime$, is obtained by subtracting $\delta$ from every row of $F$. This is easy in `numpy`, as it supports automatically broadcasting arrays of different dimensions together. You can simply let $\delta$ be a 1 x 3 matrix instead when programming.

Initially, I added an additional optimization to crawl gait which involved rotating the body about the line produced by $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ away from the lifted leg. This lowers the COM, which improves stability. However, the tilting was causing too much shake to the camera, so I took it out. It may be useful to you, so I'll include some basic information here. 

We can use the [Euler–Rodrigues formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Rodrigues_formula) to generate a rotation matrix. I took the code for it off of [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6802577/python-rotation-of-3d-vector). The function, when given an axis and angle, will generate a 3 x 3 matrix that I'll call $Q$. To apply this rotation to the aforementioned 4 x 3 matrix, we use a [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) along with a [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose).

$$F^{\prime\prime} = F^\prime Q^T$$

COM adjustments don't need to occur when the robot is on four legs. Thus, modifying $F$ is only necessary on three legs. However, this algorithm can be jerky because the robot has to shift the COM rapidly in a single $dt$ segment. I've had a servo burn out because of this problem. A better algorithm would preemptively transition the COM even when the robot is on four legs so that it does not need to jerk when a leg lifts. Implementation involves looking at when all four legs are on the ground and when they are not. Then, simply run a smoothing algorithm that takes a large adjustment $\delta$ and breaks it up over multiple $dt$ frames.

Does it get more complicated? Of course! At higher speeds, $\delta$ can actually cause significant acceleration on the body. With acceleration in play, the COM is no longer crucial. Instead, the [zero moment point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_moment_point) (ZMP) must fall inside of the support triangle. With no acceleration, the ZMP is equal to the COM. However, with acceleration, it gets really fun. See [this paper](http://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/59530) for more information.

But wait, if you adjust for the ZMP, doesn't that also create another different acceleration that you have to optimize? You see, it gets very complicated. Using ZMP is necessary for bipedal robots and could improve quadrupedal walking a lot. However, it is way beyond my level of understanding. Feel free to look into it if you have time.

### Pose Optimization

Say you wanted the robot to get from its current pose to another pose. However, you don't want it to fall over of drag its legs on the ground. This is where pose optimization comes. Theoretically, pose optimization should allow the robot to get from any valid pose to any other valid pose.

The first step would be to use forward kinematics equations to determine the current location of all the legs. Then, move the body and lift the legs one at a time until all are in the correct location. Whenever a leg lifts, perform static optimizations. The logic is actually a bit more complex that, but the source code and comments could explain more clearly than words because there is no new math involved.

### Dynamic Optimization

These optimizations are done while the robot is running. However, I did not have time to implement them. Dynamic optimizations require the use of pressure sensors on the feet or at least an inertial measurement unit (IMU). As I have no implementation, I will simply provide some thoughts in this section.

Foot sensors will allow the robot to determine if it is falling in one direction or if it has a foot hold. It can be used to traverse uneven terrain. For example, if there is decreasing force on one feet when not expected, the robot may be tilting away from the feet.

An IMU can be fused to find the orientation of the robot. Combine this with raw acceleration data and you can find out if the robot is falling or about to fall. Acceleration is more useful in computing the ZMP in real time. If you do manage to get this data, you can use it to compute the ZMP and dynamically adjust the robot during motion. Assuming the COM remains at a constant height, then the ZMP, $z$, can be computed using the COM $(c_x, c_y, c_z)$ and the acceleration of the COM $(a_x, a_y, a_z)$.

$$z_x = \frac{c_x g - c_z a_x}{g}$$

This also applies for $z_y$. Again, this is just math. Actual implementation may require significant tweaking.

### Code

Multiple classes are involved in motion. A few functions in the `Agility` class are outdated and were used for testing. Other functions which relate to the head are discussed later.

# Vision

I worked on the vision system for nearly a semester before beginning on walking. To be honest, I don't understand a lot the algorithms used to make everything work. I just know that it works. A lot more details can be seen in the SPS and POC documents.

### Tracking

The mission specified tracking of randomly moving prey. I looked at various tracking algorithms and found that most of them were not open source. I found implementation of two correlation-based trackers that were fast and worked well. In the end, I chose to use the [Discriminative Scale Space Tracker](http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/en/research/objrec/visualtracking/scalvistrack/index.html) (DSST). Near mission day however, it did not work due to excessive shaking during walking. This is not very difficult to fix but we lacked the time to redesign the head. Thus, I just gave up on it.

During testing, the tracker worked very well. I also implemented recovery mechanisms so that the tracker can automatically determine if an object is obstructed or out of view. Tracking is also learning-based. It basically took some template images and stored them. If an object is lost, it would apply detection (described below) to propose object locations to DSST.

### Detection

I used a template-based detection because it assisted with tracking and learning. The implementation was based on the [LINE2D](http://far.in.tum.de/pub/hinterstoisser2011pami/hinterstoisser2011pami.pdf) algorithm and OpenCV's code for a 3D version of the algorithm. The algorithm could match over 2,000 templates in real time, which is at least an order of magnitude faster than OpenCV's conventional Fourier-based template matching. It could also detect multiple objects with one template. 

By itself, it is not particularly useful. However, when combined with tracking and learning, it can be used to increase the robot's awareness of its surroundings.

### SLAM

We lacked funds to buy sophisticated SLAM equipment. I used [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2), an accurate single camera SLAM system that worked very well. However, it required a lot of RAM and processing power to run in real time. Thus, it had to be done on the command center. SLAM never made it to mission day, since I lacked testing time. 

However, I did manage to make functional Python bindings. There is a memory leak issue with the vocabulary system but it shouldn't affect actual performance as the vocabulary is only loaded once. ORB-SLAM was designed to work with one camera. I tried to tweak the algorithm to allow multiple robots to simultaneous contribute to the global map -- it did not really work. If you have time, definitely look into this SLAM system. I believe it has a lot of potential.

### Optimization

Getting vision to run in real time on a computer like a Raspberry Pi is not easy in any way. All of the vision is written in C++ and a lot of it is optimized using SSE and NEON intrinsics. I took the pains to do that already. This means that tracking and detection can work in real time on the Raspberry Pi 3 or ODROID-C2!

I'm sure a lot of other optimizations are possible. However, be warned that you're going to basically be writing assembly at this point. It might not be nice like Python.

### Head

This is one portion of the robot that I actually worked out pretty nicely, so I have more to say about it. The goal was to get the head to turn appropriately and follow objects. Be warned, I am no expert on optics.

![](assets/head.png)

As you can see in the image, a camera has some field of view (FOV). The angle is what we're interested in. You can measure this angle manually. Do not read the FOV off the specification sheet. It can be inaccurate. The idea is that given an object center on an image of a certain size, to determine how many degrees to turn the camera so that the object is a the center.

The math is easily understandable in the code, so I do not need to explain it here. However, you have to notice a very important feature. The FOV is a triangle. Pretend that the object of interest lies somewhere on the blue line. Regardless of how far it is from the camera, it's position would not be different on the screen. The center of the object would be at the same location whether you are interested in the red line or the black line. Thus, a good angle approximation would simply involve a ratio of the center of the object to the width of the image captured with the measured FOV.

Obviously, this is only an approximation. Since obtaining new images is relatively cheap, this algorithm can be fed through a [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) loop to obtain good results.

### Code

A lot of the vision modules are written in C++ and forked from other projects. I have developed Python bindings for all of them using Boost Python.

Concept|Implementation(s)
:---|---
Tracking| `theia.main.Oculus`, `theia.tracker.DSST`
Detection|	`theia.matcher.LineMatcher`
SLAM | `theia.slam.python.test`, `pyslam`
Camera | `theia.eye.Eye`
Head | `agility.main.Agility.look_at`, `agility.main.Agility.scan`, ``agility.main.Agility.move_head`

# Audio

Originally, the mission specified that a two legged walker needed to detect the howl in "Werewolves of London". I wrote the code for it, even though it was taken out of the final mission.

### Concepts

Most of the math is detailed in the SPS document. Implementation can be done using `pyaudio`. Some webcams come with integrated microphones, which work well in detecting the frequency of music. The rest is pretty self-explanatory.

### Code

All of the code is hosted in one class.

Concept|Implementation(s)
:---|---
Audio| `lykos.apollo.Apollo`

# Communication

Communication is crucial as there are many components in the robot that must work together. In addition, the robots must be aware of each other and the person in command.

### Workers

Python is not very memory efficient. It is also not a good idea to bunch everything into one process, because a single error can cause the entire system to crash. In addition, it gets difficult to synchronize everything. I worked around this by spawning multiple worker processes. Each process was thread-safe, and accepted remote calls. Any process can call functions from any other process and get return values. This type of remove proxy can be implemented very easily using `Pyro4`.

### Networking

Python 3.5 comes with the `asyncio` module. The same concept of remote calls can be applied by using asynchronous processing with `Crossbar` and `autobahn`. One main networking process is spawned. This process can call remote functions on any one of the worker processes and receive calls made from the command center. Due to the versatility of `Crossbar`, the command center does not have to be in Python. It can written natively in JavaScript. This type of remote procedure call and publish / subscribe model is detailed in the SPS and POC.

### Camera

The camera should be running on a stream server. The reason is so that multiple resources, including external systems, can access the stream without blocking each other. OpenCV supports reading MJPEG streams and I've written a simple threaded camera server in Python.

### Code

A lot of the code involved in communication embed a lot other modules. These are basically the top layer of the framework.

Concept|Implementation(s)
:---|---
Workers | `cerebral.pack*.worker1`, `cerebral.pack*.worker3`
Networking | `cerebral.pack*.main`
Camera | `cerebral.pack*.worker2`

# Automation

The original intention was for the robot to be fully autonomous. However, this could not happen because the vision system failed and I lacked testing time. However, I will provide some thoughts here on what I've tried.

### Synthesis

In order to automate, motion and vision must be linked together. The basic idea is to obtain some vision data, decide the desired motion, and repeat. It works well, but I have not been able to optimize the algorithm to function fully on the actual robot. In addition, there must be away to accept external overrides efficiently. Think about what functions are blocking and whether it will prevent other functions from being executed at the same time.

### Decision Making

The most basic decision is where to move the robot. In particular, what forward and rotational speeds are desired. This type of decision making can be done by using vision data in a PID loop. Other types of decision making literally involve a bunch of if statements. I have personally not gone any further than the basic motion decision making, although obtaining the required data to make the decision is the harder part. A lot of testing and tweaking of parameters may be required.

### Code

Much of the implementation is relatively incomplete. Feel free to improve them if you have time.

Concept|Implementation(s)
:---|---
Synthesis | `cerebral.tests.worker3._follow`
Decision Making | `ares.main.Ares.compute_vector`

# Control

How to design a control interface for the robot is really open ended. However, the easiest method is probably to go with a web-based control system. It looks nice and can be developed quickly.

### Considerations

When developing the control system, be sure to ensure emergency shutoff systems in case something goes wrong. Try to find a library that is natively supported by the communication scheme you choose. If using `Crossbar`, I would recommend using the `autobahn` JavaScript package. It works very well. Everything else can be seen in the code.

### Code

In order to use the front end interfaces `phi`, you first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and use it get all dependencies.

```bash
cd src/zeus/phi
npm install

gulp build
gulp watch
```

After building, opening up `index.html` in a browser should show the command interface. However, note that the system was only tested in Chrome and voice recognition and speech synthesis are exclusive to Chrome at the moment.

# Material Selection

I was not in charge of material selection. However, I have a few observations to note.

### Body

The body material is not too important. Just make sure its cheap and you can easily drill holes into it. However, the material should be strong enough that it does not bend or twist. If the body bends, it can mess up kinematics computations for the legs and throw off the COM.

### Legs

Surprisingly, 3D-printed material works well for legs! The only problem is the screws. We ended up just using nuts. Trying to screw directly into plastic is not a good idea. We also tried using sheet metal. However, the bends must be accurate or else the legs will be very tilted and inaccurate.

# Component Selection

There are a lot of different components that can be used for the robot. However, some are better than others.

### Servos

We used the [DSS-M15S](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=156_51_108&product_id=1177#.V5_uaTsrKUk) servos. They provide 270 degrees of rotation and provide a lot of torque. We were really bad at computing torque. However, definitely look for a servo with more than 10 kg*cm of torque. The 270 degree freedom was originally intended to allow the robot to flip itself over when it got on its back. In addition, we were supposed to build another transforming robot, which would definitely more than 180 degrees of freedom. Generally, 180 degrees servos are fine if you are only working with quadrupeds. Be sure to look carefully at the specification sheets for amperage draw and speed. 

### Microcontroller

We used the [Mini Maestro 18](https://www.pololu.com/product/1354) servo controller and the [ODROID-C2](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G145457216438). Make sure that the computing device has a fast processor that supports NEON intrinsics if you want to use vision. Most ARM-A processor should work fine. The ODROID-C2 is great because it has 2 GB of RAM.

### Battery

Servos drain a lot of amps. This is a problem if the computer is hooked up to the same battery. We had a problem where the network would randomly cut off and the robot would turn into a zombie. This is not surprising, because the wireless dongle actually draws some amperage. Measure and test to ensure that this does not happen to you. Optimally, have a separate battery for the on-board computer.

Try to choose a rechargeable batter that can supply the necessary amperage and compute the runtime to ensure that the robot does not die in 5 minutes. Also, monitor the battery voltage. Smart battery chargers will not charge over-discharged Li-Po batteries because it is dangerous. Never go below 3.0 volts per cell!

### Camera

Any USB webcam should work for most purposes. You don't need a high resolution camera because the computer cannot even process HD frames in real time. It is best if the camera can encode MJPEG using hardware as it will stress the CPU less. In addition, it should support [UVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class) if easy Linux compatibility is desired.
