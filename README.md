# Red Eclipse Framework

This repository contains all code used by Eclipse Technologies in the 2016 CARPA Initiative Challenge - The Lycanthrope Project. Failure in any aspect of the project is not in any way related to deficiencies in the code of this framework.

### The Mission

One transforming walker with two quadruped robots that can autonomously seek out and capture a randomly moving prey on the field using RFID. Sounds hard? It was. Find out more information about the mission in the `docs` folder. 

### The Robot

Although the final iteration of CAD files for the robot were lost, I managed to reconstruct and redesign the robot with more reasonable alignment and features. The CAD is very similar to the robot used on mission day, but is not identical. Materials are correctly defined but I probably made some parts too glossy. Various attachments and wires are not shown. The image is the result of 2,000 rendering iterations.
